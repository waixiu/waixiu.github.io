    "text": "Hello! My name is Xiuhua Wang and currently I am an associate professor of the School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.\nI received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2020, under the supervision of Professor Sherman S. M. Chow. I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong in 2014.\nMy research interests span the areas of applied cryptography, cryptographic protocols, public-key cryptography, and privacy protection in machine learning. My current research primarily focuses on:\n\nThe design of post-quantum cryptography protocols;\nThe optimization of access control encryption;\nPrivacy preservation in distributed machine learning.\n\nMy work aims to advance the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of secure cryptographic systems, with the goal of enhancing data privacy, integrity, and trust in emerging distributed and intelligent computing environments.\nOpening:\n\nMy lab is opening for self-motivated master or PhD students with strong interest(s) in my research areas.\nIf you are an HUST (undergraduate/master) student and would like to explore cyber security with me, drop me an email."
